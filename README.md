    <b><i>READING A LINE FROM A FILE DESCRIPTOR</i></b><br>

## 💡 About the project

> _The aim of this project is to create a function that reads a line from a file descriptor._

Reading a line from a file can be challenging, especially when dealing with different file sizes and formats. The `get_next_line` project at 42tokyo provides you with the opportunity to implement a function that efficiently reads a line from a file descriptor, allowing you to handle file input in a more versatile manner.

## ⚠️ Implementation Notes

- `BUFFER_SIZE` is defined at compile time and controls the chunk size used during reading.
- Proper memory management and handling multiple file descriptors (bonus part) were key challenges.

## 🚀 Updates

### Integrated into libft

> _The `get_next_line` function has been seamlessly integrated into the [libft](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/libft) library as an additional feature._

- The integration with [libft](https://github.com/jayjayjay-hub/libft) enhances the utility of the library by providing a function to read lines from file descriptors.

These updates extend the functionality of the `get_next_line` project, making it a valuable addition to your C programming toolkit at 42tokyo.
