## 💡 About the project

> _The aim of this project is to create a function that reads a line from a file descriptor._

Reading a line from a file can be challenging, especially when dealing with different file sizes and formats. The `get_next_line` project at 42tokyo provides you with the opportunity to implement a function that efficiently reads a line from a file descriptor, allowing you to handle file input in a more versatile manner.

## 🚀 Updates
